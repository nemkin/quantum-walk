\section{From classical to quantum walks}

Classical random walks describe a stohastic process

Tool in mathematics for modeling discrete time and discrete space stochastic processes.

Classical random walks on graphs can be defined using Markov-chains. Markov-chains
are well explained in Leo Breiman's book on Probability\cite{breiman_probability_1992}.

\definition{\textbf{Markov-chain}} A Markov-chain is a process consisting of random variables
